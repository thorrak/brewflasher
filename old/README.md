# The "old" directory

One of the most difficult parts of BrewFlasher comes at the end of development: Packaging the application for 
distribution. This is true for both MacOS, where the application must be signed and notarized before it can be 
distributed, and for Windows, where the bootloader must be recompiled so as to not trigger Windows Defender.

This folder contains scripts that were used in the past as part of the packaging process, in case they are needed again
at some point in the future. These scripts are not actively in use for current versions of BrewFlasher.
